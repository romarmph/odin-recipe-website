    <p>Chicken kabobs marinated in a sweet and sour sauce are a fun alternative to usual barbecue fare. The honey-soy mixture does double duty as a marinade and a basting sauce, adding delicious flavor to every bite of juicy chicken. Use fresh mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, or other veggies and marinate overnight if desired. Don't have a grill? These can be cooked under your broiler.</p>
