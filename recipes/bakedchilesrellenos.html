    <p>Delicious baked chiles rellenos without the fat of frying. Serve with Mexican beans and rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 medium poblano peppers</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package queso fresco</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Roast peppers on the top rack of the preheated oven until the skins are charred, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the oven and allow to cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Set the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While peppers are cooling, whisk eggs, flour, milk, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl until smooth. Slice the queso fresco into eight even rectangles, just shorter than the length of the peppers.</li>
        <li>Carefully peel off the waxy skin of the cooled peppers. Gently cut a slit down the length of the peppers and use a spoon to remove the seeds and membranes.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/4 cup of the milk mixture on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Wrap each pepper around a queso fresco rectangle. Place each chile/cheese wrap seam-side down in a single layer in the baking dish. Cover with remaining egg mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the egg mixture has risen and the cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
